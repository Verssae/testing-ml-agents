In this repository, we aim to detect physical defects by using reinforcement learning-based agents in complex 3D environments for exploratory testing. For this purpose, we provide a simple 3D game called `FindCube`. In FindCube, the player navigates a space filled with elevators, ramps, jump pads, and obstacles to locate and press a randomly generated switch, after which a randomly generated cube appears that the player must collect to complete the game. Additionally, this repository includes the source code and trained models for the following two published papers.
